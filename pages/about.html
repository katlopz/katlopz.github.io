<h1>About</h1>
<p>I am a Wellington based coder interested in software and game development. Particularly exploring how in-game actions can 
            directly impact the composition of music; ensuring that every playthrough is a new sonic experience. </p>
          <p>In the compositional field, I am currently working on a singer-songwriter debut album titled <i>31</i>, 
            a collection of songs each written on consecutive days in January 2021. I hope to work on one song each 
            day in months that exclusively have 31 days.</p>
